It is a React Native app inspired from the sorting hat from the world of Harry Potter.
In this you'll be randomly sorted to a house after clicking the Sort Button.
You can also edit your image with stickers of Congratulations,House Images and others.
Also there is a language switcher too, where you can switch the languages of house names to English or Hinglish.
